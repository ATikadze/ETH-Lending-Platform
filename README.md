# ETH - USDT Lending Platform

#### About:

This platform allows users to borrow ETH by providing USDT as collateral. Itâ€™s composed of four key contracts: **LendingPlatform**, **Collaterals**, **LendingPool**, and **Loans**, each handling a specific part of the system.

- **LendingPlatform** serves as the main entry point, coordinating interactions between the loans, lending pool, and collateral contracts. Borrowers can deposit USDT as collateral and take out ETH loans, while lenders provide ETH liquidity to the platform.
  
- **Collaterals** manages collateral-related operations, including deposits, withdrawals, and liquidation. It monitors the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, ensuring that the value of the collateral remains sufficient. If the LTV ratio exceeds a safe threshold, the collateral is liquidated to cover the debt. This contract also integrates Chainlink price feeds to fetch the USDT/ETH price and Uniswap for swapping assets during liquidation.

- **LendingPool** is responsible for managing ETH deposits from lenders and distributing ETH to borrowers. It tracks the available liquidity and allocates loans based on available capital. Lenders can deposit and withdraw ETH, while the contract handles repayments from borrowers.

- **Loans** tracks individual loans, including their amounts, collateral, and repayment status. It calculates interest on loans and manages repayments, as well as handling loan changes through the liquidation process.

The platform ensures secure and decentralized lending by enforcing strict collateral management and integrating well-known services like Chainlink for price data and Uniswap for liquidity management.
